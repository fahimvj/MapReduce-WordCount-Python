a 200
the 160
in 80
to 80
his 80
of 80
and 80
through 80
Once 40
upon 40
time 40
quiet 40
village, 40
there 40
lived 40
storyteller. 40
Every 40
evening, 40
people 40
gathered 40
hear 40
enchanting 40
tales. 40
His 40
stories 40
spoke 40
bravery, 40
wisdom, 40
peace. 40
Children 40
sat 40
awe 40
as 40
dragons 40
flew 40
words. 40
Elders 40
nodded, 40
remembering 40
times 40
long 40
past. 40
Each 40
tale 40
ended 40
with 40
lesson, 40
message 40
hope. 40
The 40
storyteller's 40
voice 40
echoed 40
like 40
wind 40
trees. 40
Night 40
after 40
night, 40
village 40
grew 40
wiser. 40
Peace, 40
love, 40
unity 40
became 40
village's 40
creed. 40
Even 40
stars 40
seemed 40
listen. 40
